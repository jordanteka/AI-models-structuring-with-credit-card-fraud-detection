Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The dataset used is a credit fraud detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains transaction records labeled as fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0). The goal is to build, evaluate, and compare multiple machine learning models to identify the best-performing model for fraud detection.

Features & Dataset

The dataset consists of:

Time: The transaction timestamp.

V1-V28: Anonymized numerical features.

Amount: Transaction amount.

Class: Target variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = Non-Fraud).

Project Steps

Step 1: Data Loading & Preprocessing

Load the dataset using pandas.

Handle missing values (if any).

Normalize the Amount feature.

Address class imbalance using techniques like undersampling/oversampling.

Step 2: Train-Test Split & Feature Scaling

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Standardize features using StandardScaler.

Step 3: Train Machine Learning Models

We implemented the following models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Step 4: Model Evaluation & Comparison

Each model was evaluated based on:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

Confusion Matrix (Visualized with Seaborn)

Step 5: Best Model Selection

The model with the highest accuracy and best fraud detection metrics was selected.

The confusion matrices were analyzed to assess false positives/negatives.

Results & Findings

The best-performing model based on accuracy was [insert best model name] with an accuracy of [insert accuracy].

Recall and Precision for fraud detection were prioritized since fraud cases are rare but critical.
